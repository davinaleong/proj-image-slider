# Image Slider

Here is my solution to an image slider. This is not a CSS-only solution. I decided to go with a JavaScript solution as it's simpler to implement.

Feel free to use the code for your own projects. You can modify the styles to your liking. What's important are the data attributes as they are used to reference the elements in the slider script.
